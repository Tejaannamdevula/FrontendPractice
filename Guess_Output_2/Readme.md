Learnings:

1. The this Keyword
   The this keyword refers to the object that invokes a function, varying based on the context of the call (e.g., object methods, constructors, global scope).
2. Arrow Functions
   Arrow functions do not have their own this. Instead, they inherit this from the surrounding lexical scope where they are defined.
